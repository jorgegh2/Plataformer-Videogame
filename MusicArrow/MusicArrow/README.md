## Innovation grade:

- Introducing the coliders in the Tiled we have implemented a system that allows the automatic creation of all the entities that are added to a queue and only spawn when they are within the limits of the camera, for which we are able to add all the entities from the Tiled.

- The animations are collected from the animations.xml file and its playback speed and loop are controlled from there.

- You can set the player and camera controls through the config.xml file.
